<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

tokofuku is an online shop website that is made specifically for e-commerce purposes, for many features to support transactions in online stores
[Demo Click Here](https://zwallet.fwdev.online)

Here's why:

- Great responsive display for any device
- Does not reload pages when moving between pages
- made with all the latest and most up-to-date tools and technology today
- two role (user & admin)
- great performance
- specially designed for e-wallet needs
- reusable components

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
